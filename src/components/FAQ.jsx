      q: "I am a beginner. Will this help me ?",
      a: "Yes, absolutely. This TEF trial class is designed to help beginners start the right way. You’ll get clarity on your starting level, a simple roadmap from A1 onwards, and guidance on how to build a strong foundation specifically for TEF preparation."
    },
    {
      q: "I have completed A1 or A2. Should I still join?",
      a: "Yes. If you’ve completed A1 or A2 but feel unsure about your next steps, timelines, or TEF readiness, this class will help you realign. Many learners complete levels but miss exam-specific preparation—this session fixes that gap."
    },
    {
      q: "Who are your trainers?",
      a: "Our trainers are experienced French language educators who specialize in TEF-focused preparation, not just general French teaching. They guide students on level progression, exam strategy, and common scoring mistakes based on real learner experiences."
    },
    {
      q: "Is career guidance included?",
      a: "Yes, but only as a free value add. Career, PR, or study-abroad guidance is shared only if relevant to your profile and is never used as a sales pitch. The core focus of the session remains TEF preparation."
    },
    {
      q: "Will I get the recording?",
      a: "Yes. A session recording is usually shared so you can revise key concepts, strategies, and the roadmap discussed during the class."
    },
    {
      q: "Is CA$ 5 refundable?",
      a: "The CA$ 5 trial fee is non-refundable. However, if you decide to enroll in the full TEF course, the CA$ 5 is adjusted in your final course fee."
